Page 3: Algorithm Patterns

Common Patterns:

1. Two Pointers
   - Use for sorted arrays or linked lists
   - One pointer at start, one at end

2. Sliding Window
   - Use for substring/subarray problems
   - Maintain a window and expand/shrink as needed

3. Binary Search
   - Use for sorted data
   - Divide and conquer approach

4. Dynamic Programming
   - Break problem into smaller subproblems
   - Store results to avoid recomputation

5. Breadth-First Search (BFS)
   - Level-by-level traversal
   - Use queue

6. Depth-First Search (DFS)
   - Go deep first
   - Use recursion or stack
